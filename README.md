### Usage

```
lldb
(lldb) help v8
The following subcommands are supported:

      bt       -- Show a backtrace with node.js JavaScript functions and their
                  args. An optional argument is accepted; if that argument is a
                  number, it specifies the number of frames to display. Otherwise
                  all frames will be dumped.

                  Syntax: v8 bt [number]
      inspect  -- Print detailed description and contents of the JavaScript
                  value.

                  Possible flags (all optional):

                  * -F, --full-string    - print whole string without adding ellipsis
                  * -m, --print-map      - print object's map address
                  * --string-length num  - print maximum of `num` characters in string

                  Syntax: v8 inspect [flags] expr
      print    -- Print short description of the JavaScript value.

                  Syntax: v8 print expr
