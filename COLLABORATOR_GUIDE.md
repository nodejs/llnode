# llnode Collaborator Guide

llnode follows the
[Node.js Collaborator Guide](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/COLLABORATOR_GUIDE.md),
with the following differences:

  - At least one Collaborator must approve a pull request before the pull
    request lands.
  - There's no minimum wait time for landing a pull request. Pull requests can
    land as soon as they get approved by at least one Collaborator.
  - Approval must be from Collaborators who are not authors of the change.
  - If the pull request was open for three days (72 hours) without reviews, and
    it was opened by a llnode Collaborator, the pull request can land without
    approvals.
